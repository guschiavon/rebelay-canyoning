      As the team progressed further into Malishan, various large tributary

      Rockfall was a constant threat to the team. A recent earthquake resulted
      in various dangerous passages featuring precarious slabs and loose
      boulders.

      Increased flow meant the team had to carefully manage the heavy 30+ kg
