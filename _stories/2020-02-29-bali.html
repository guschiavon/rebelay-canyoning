  The most established routes are in the Buleleng regency, namely in the
  surrounding areas of Gitgit and Sambangan villages. Remote descents like
  technical Tamata (pictured) require contacting local operators.

  Some spectacular narrows in Tukad Dalam during the first descent in April
  2019. The remoteness of the Balinese canyons means you will find these places
  all for yourself during a descent. Despite, the wild environment requires
  local knowledge to be experienced safely.

  Volcanic basalt is the predominant rock type in Bali's canyons, providing
  incredible vertical descents and narrow gorges. The anchors are maintained by
  the local commercial operators and are generally found to be in good
  conditions year round.

  The wet season provides exciting water levels but some canyons might not be
  accessible; it also requires careful planning due to the daily tropical
  downpours which often result in flash floods. Here, Re:belay Editor Gus
  Schiavon during the first descent of Tukad Marah, Sekumpul.

        Normally associated with paradisiac beaches, surfing and spirituality, Bali also features some amazing canyoning descents. Located in the remote mountaineous areas in the north part of the island, the canyons are normally surrounded by lush jungle, picture-perfect rice fields and the simple and honest smile of the local Balinese community. Currently there is no topo guide book for Bali canyoning but it is a project that Imin is dedicated to bring out soon.
      </p>
      <p class="editable">
        For those who wish to visit the island's canyons, it is suggested to contact the local commercial operators for information on canyon conditions and equipment requirements. Due to the remoteness of these places and lack of specialized rescue teams, hiring a local logistics specialist is paramount for peace of mind and for a pleasant experience; if it happens to be Imin, you'll also get to count on some amazing images such as the ones featured in this article. Read on for a glimpse of what Bali canyons have on offer.

      One of the longest descents in Bali, Tukad Api (or Canyon of Fire, first image) is a must-do when in the Island of Gods. A total of 6-hrs of full committment inside the lush jungle with rappels up to 40m high, a guarantee of a special experience. Second image: the final narrows of Tukad Dalam, Kubutambahan, which has seen only one full descent.
