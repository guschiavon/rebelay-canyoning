      The most established routes are in the Buleleng regency, namely in the
      surrounding areas of Gitgit and Sambangan villages. Here, Anjas Asmara
      descends Colek Pamor, one of the most technical waterfalls in Yeh Mampeh
      canyon.

      Some spectacular narrows in Tukad Dalam during the first descent in April
      2019. The remoteness of the Balinese canyons means you will find these
      places all for yourself during a descent. Despite, the wild environment
      requires local knowledge to be experienced safely.

      Volcanic basalt is the predominant rock type in Bali's canyons, providing
      incredible vertical descents and narrow gorges. The anchors are maintained
      by the local commercial operators and are generally found to be in good
      conditions year round.

  Normally associated with paradisiac beaches, surfing and spirituality, Bali also features some amazing canyoning descents. Located in the remote mountaineous areas in the north part of the island, the canyons are normally surrounded by lush jungle, picture-perfect rice fields and the simple and honest smile of the local Balinese community. Currently there is no topo guide book for Bali canyoning but it is a project that Imin is dedicated to bring out soon.

  For those who wish to visit the island's canyons, it is suggested to contact the local commercial operators for information on canyon conditions and equipment requirements. Due to the remoteness of these places and lack of specialized rescue teams, hiring a local logistics specialist is paramount for peace of mind and for a pleasant experience; if it happens to be Imin, you'll also get to count on some amazing images such as the ones featured in this article. Read on for a glimpse of what Bali canyons have on offer.
