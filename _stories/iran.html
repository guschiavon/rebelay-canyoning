        The plane touches down as we approach midnight. It&rsquo;s June, and the Islamic world still observes the holy month of Ramadan. At Tehran&rsquo;s Imam Khomeini International Airport, I quickly make my way through immigration to the busy arrivals hall. It&rsquo;s not long until a tall, slender figure with big, penetrating eyes and olive skin - true Persian fixtures - approaches me, her Farsi accent noticeable through her perfect English: &ldquo;Welcome to Iran! We&rsquo;re very excited to show you our country&rdquo;. Her name is Tina Andayesh, one of the most active and passionate Iranian canyoneers and the organizer of the itinerary: a cross-country, 2-week long road trip experiencing the best canyons of each region.

      Through our earlier contacts and her busy social media profile, I could tell that Tina was deeply involved with the activity in Iran. I begin to ask her about the local canyoning community while she drives through the hectic late-night traffic in Tehran: &ldquo;In the past, the local mountaineering federation has invited organizations such as the French Speleology Federation and American Canyoneering Academy to come over and give us technical knowledge, which has supported the creation of a small canyoning community&rdquo; she replies. They are now eager to show the sport&rsquo;s local potential to a wider audience and make efforts to establish the country as reference for the activity in the Middle East. &ldquo;We really need more canyoneers to come visit, experience our outdoors and share with the local community&rdquo; she concludes.<br />In regards of canyons, Iran is pretty well set-up. The country&rsquo;s topography presents 2 main mountain ranges: the cooler, greener Alborz in the north and the massive, deserted Zagros range spanning from west to south, with some peaks reaching 4,000m. Tina&rsquo;s plan would take us to both areas, with the Zagros the one offering the most potential: lengthy, multi-day descents in stunning scenery, tracing the limestone canyons from springs to the main flow of the rood, or river in Farsi. The remoteness of these places often requires arduous approaches, either on foot or through precarious off-road sections. Very few canyons are located close to large cities like Tehran, Shiraz or Isfahan, making logistics difficult. Most will take more than 2 days between preparation and descent and each trip is organized like a true expedition.

    After a week of preparations in Tehran, it&rsquo;s time to take the road. Our first stop is the Alamut region situated amidst the Alborz Mountains range, north of the capital. We&rsquo;re here to descend 2 canyons - Asemanrood and Chakhrood - and rendezvous with a group of 15 canyoneers during the next 2 days. It is also here that I meet Tina&rsquo;s partner, Amir Jelvani, who is Iran&rsquo;s most prolific canyoning instructor and explorer. Despite our language barriers, Amir oozes sympathy: his contagious personality turns us instantly into long-time friends, and we&rsquo;re quickly discussing preferences on canyoning gear and techniques.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="editable">
    The descent of Asemanrood would allows us to develop the team dynamics and discuss best practices, presenting a good mix of verticality and whitewater challenges. The large group is split in 2, and I float between both in order to observe, document and exchange. The flat upper section features small pools which - at a lower water level - present no danger. This is not the case, as it&rsquo;s still early summer and higher-than-average flows have been the norm. It&rsquo;s not long until I arrive at an obstacle and panic is ensuing: 3 people were drowning due to their poor assessment of the situation, having jumped into a highly-aerated pool featuring dangerous hydraulics while wearing their heavy backpacks. Luckily, all manage to escape with the help of the team. Later in the day I speak to Amir about the episode. We agree that Iranian canyoneers are very eager to increase their portfolio of rope techniques but often oversee the development of their whitewater skills, counting on traverses to overcome these types of obstacles. As the canyoning activity grows in popularity, so does the number of participants who naively assume their limited knowledge is sufficient for complicated scenarios presented in the canyon environment.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="editable">
    Despite the shortcomings Amir &amp; his team continue to spearhead the development of the sport in Iran, having established a training course program which supports the growth of the local community while reinforcing its safety standards. Most of their time has been dedicated to re-bolting the country&rsquo;s main routes to European standards (double anchors); the investment on this material has come from Amir&rsquo;s own pocket. &ldquo;There is a big demand for canyoning training courses, but as long as we don&rsquo;t develop a safe local industry, people will not take us seriously&rdquo;.

        Packing all the equipment and food we would need was a challenge on its own. Our technical approach clothes were as compact and light as possible, but we still had to carry wetsuits, harnesses, 240m of rope, a power drill and anchoring material, let alone the video and photo gear to document our descent. Hefting 55L packs, on average we were carrying 30kg each.

        The crux of the approach was an intense traverse of a narrow and unstable ridge. Thick cloud and rain added to the ambiance, as one-by-one we edged across this sketchy section with our heavy backpacks. Progress was slow as we tried to get our bearings. A Tyrolean traverse was then needed in order to overcome a bluff section, which set us back another two hours.&nbsp;

        Making use of natural features &amp; pitons still remained the team&rsquo;s priority. A nice sequence of three falls measuring 30, 70 and 100 metres brought the day to an end, just as daylight began to fade and the rain became stronger. We found a flat ledge in between two massive landslides and set up camp. Under a tarp, Ryoji Onishi, the team&rsquo;s lead climber &amp; sawanobori expert, managed to light a fire despite the wet wood. We warmed up and rejoiced. We were finally in.

Our map&rsquo;s accuracy was called into question when we came across three pinnacles, amid near-shear and inaccessible terrain, none of which were marked. As the day progressed, it became clear that we would not reach the head of the canyon by dusk. We were forced to establish an improvised bivouac on a ledge next to loose-looking rock; not long before we witnessed a massive rockfall in the valley below. We began to wonder if we had made the right choice of route.<br /><br />Cold, wet and with no visual references to either side, we decided to make a push towards the valley below rather than spend another night on the ridge. Finally, we came across old trail markers, which we followed to an abandoned mountain hut, our desired camp spot. It had needed a slice of luck as well as good judgement, but we had made it to the start of the canyon.<br /><br />To our surprise, the upper section featured extremely hard schist, no choice of natural anchors or suitable cracks for our pitons. The rigging team - those in charge of establishing anchors for us to rappel off - burned out two out of our five drill bits on the first two drops, a very poor ratio that had us worrying about further attrition for the rest of the trip.&nbsp;

        Next morning we got a clearer view of our situation. Although not especially narrow, steep walls flanked the canyon&rsquo;s sides rendering escape nearly impossible. The scale was impressive. We came across numerous tributary streams which fed the main river, and Malishan began to step up its aquatic rating, although loose rock was still the main threat. Moving efficiently &amp; overcoming diverse whitewater obstacles, we made good progress and arrived at the start of the third gorge, the longest of them all. It was again late to start on such a committing section, and we decided to set up camp despite the lack of an appropriate space. With loose rock above our small shelf, we would all need to sleep with our helmets on and hope for good weather overnight.

      <p class="editable">
        &ldquo;We could possibly finish the canyon tomorrow,&rdquo; Mike has said optimistically the previous night, as we analyzed the topography for the upcoming section. But although there was only 100m of vertical to lose over a kilometre-long stretch, we had underestimate the challenge of the increased water levels in the final part of the canyon. The weather wasn&rsquo;t helping either, dousing us with heavy showers through the morning, slowing progress so that we arrived at the beginning of the last 4th and final gorge only at midday.&nbsp;

      <p class="editable">
        &ldquo;It will be extremely difficult to cross that,&rdquo; said Andrew, as we looked out from the top of the drop at a 15m waterfall ending in a giant, recirculating pool. It was decided that we should attempt to set up the anchors for this and the subsequent drop, ascend back the first two drops&nbsp; and set up camp once more. Akira Tanaka, one of the strongest white water canyoneers I know, made a determined effort to swim across the current, but without success. We also couldn&rsquo;t set up a floating anchor - where a backpack is used to tension a rope by tossing it over the following drop, serving as a guideline for a swimmer &ndash; the pack just eddying uselessly. Perhaps a <em>sawanobori</em> traverse, involving a lengthy, technical climb around the pool, would be necessary?

      <p class="editable">
        Overcoming the crux pool was a huge task for the team. With an improvised bivouac in a cave overseeing the drop, the team discussed the potential solutions for the obstacle. The increase in water levels due to constant rain meant the current was so strong to be overcome even by strong swimmers. A double floating anchor set-up was the solution to get the team through and out just in time before the floods arrived.&nbsp;

      With more rain the following morning, it was clear we had to finish the canyon before the water reached unpassable levels, having already risen some 2 inches overnight. We came up with the idea of using a throw bag as the means to direct the larger rope bag over the edge of the drop. Our ingenuity was immediately rewarded, succeeding at the first attempt, thus scrapping the need for the sawanobori traverse. Akira then roped up and used the guideline to pull himself across, the force of the water trying to pin him against the wall. We watched from the top as he struggled with the current. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Akira!&rdquo; we all screamed, the fate of the day, and the whole trip, in his hands. After five long minutes he finally stood up at the edge of the pool, arms raised, and we could celebrate. The crux had been overcome.

      Tired but knowing that it wasn&rsquo;t long until we reached the end, we progress through a short section while carefully overcoming fragile &amp; unstable rockfalls. The last of us crossed the Malishan river as the water started to turn brown from sediment brought down by the rain. We were out, and smiles and camaraderie ensued. The longest self-sufficient canyoning exploration ever was finally real. Another 800m of vertical gain through untracked terrain lay ahead to get back to our pick-up point, but we were happy to leave that for the following day.&nbsp;

    <p class="editable">
      The gruelling return hike to the top of the mountain was the last challenge before we reached the village where we had been dropped off 8 days ago. We shared the stories and remembered the obstacles, scenery and team work necessary to overcome such a canyon. Our driver met us with a smile, warm sweet tea and some snacks. We couldn't be more grateful.<br /><br />Taiwan is now a mythical destination for canyoneers seeking long and challenging descents. The job is done.
