      Taiwan’s mountains are no secret but while hiking the peaks and serrated
      ridgelines is increasingly popular with locals and visitors alike, the
      gorges that lie between them are far less explored. Japanese river
      tracers, known as sawanobori or shower climbers, have already ventured
      deep into many of the country’s gorges, relying on local knowledge to help
      them navigate their way upstream. But certain streams and rivers have
      proved to be nearly impossible to climb using their current techniques and
      expertise, naturally leaving them curious about what lies above and
      beyond.

      Dangerous, exposed passages with plenty of loose rock and the added risk
      of aftershocks: the approach to Malishan was an adventure on its own.

      As the team descended into day 5 (the second inside the canyon), the water
      levels began to rise significantly due to tributary streams feeding
      Malishan.

      If you can’t climb up, maybe you can climb go down, went our rationale.
      Fired up by the adventurous tales told by the sawanobori, in 2015 I joined
      an international team of canyoneers who were pooling knowledge with the
      sawanobori on an exploration of one of Taiwan’s longest and most remote
      gorges. The project was to be split into two legs, the first taking place
      over two weeks in October 2015 and the second, over three weeks in March
      2016.

      Originally the team decided on a never-attempted multi-day descent of
      Taiwan’s longest gorge, named Qia Kan. But freakish weather brought
      unseasonal torrential rain and cold temperatures that we knew would hamper
      our efforts on the planned 12-day mission. When a weather window presented
      itself, we decided to switch to After careful consideration, we switched
      to Malishan river, a slightly shorter gorge featuring a smaller catchment,
      which we hoped could be completed before the bad weather hit.

        "Rock!" I heard Andrew scream, and I turned to see a massive slab of schist, displaced by Andrew himself, bouncing off the wall. From my relatively safe spot, I watched Ryoji below narrowly dodge the main chunk, which hit the ground and exploded into numerous small shards that went spinning through the air. From his vantage point, Andrew asked if everyone was ok. Ryoji was a little shaken but unhurt. We were all ok, but were on the verge of entering another steep gorge section of Malishan canyon, surrounded by unstable terrain. With rain expected in the evening, it wasn&rsquo;t a matter of if we would encounter loose rock again, but when.&nbsp;
